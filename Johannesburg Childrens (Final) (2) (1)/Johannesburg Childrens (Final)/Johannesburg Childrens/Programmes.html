    <h3>Development Programmes</h3>

   <p>As our children and youth go through various life stages, they experience different challenges. Through our Developmental Programmes, 
    we are able to build on their strengths by equipping them with appropriate skills in development, leadership training, mentoring and general
     life skills.</p>

     <p>Our Development Programmes include:</p>

<h4>Siphamandla – give us strength</h4>

<h4>Education programme</h4>

<p>“Education is not preparation for life, Education is life itself.” John Dewey.</p>

<p>Sadly, every child who enters our doors has an educational gap or delay due to the neglect and abuse they have experienced.
Our first task is always to assess each child’s educational needs to ensure that he or she is placed in the most appropriate school. As a result, children from our Home attend 16 different schools – carefully selected to provide them with the best possible environment to ensure that they learn and develop to their full potential.
We maintain regular contact with all these schools through our Social Workers & Child & Youth Care Workers – ensuring that our children achieve their educational goals from primary school to high school.
Many of our children have special educational needs and require individual attention in order to ensure that they don’t fall behind in their school work. Through our Educational Support Programme, part time professional teachers work one on one with children who are struggling academically, helping them grow in self-confidence and ability.
Further tertiary education or skills training is the ultimate goal of every child at the Home, as they strive towards becoming well-educated and skilled individuals in society. Contributions towards education are always needed, and carefully used to help and encourage children to reach for the stars.</p>

<h4>Educare Centre</h4>

<p>Early childhood, which happens only once and fleetingly, is the most developmentally influential and significant time of any life. 
    Children who are properly stimulated, nourished, and psychologically supported during this period will function better for their entire 
    lives. By developing physically, mentally, emotionally, and socially, they will achieve greater results at any undertaken activity, contribute more to society, 
    and participate in breaking cycles of poverty and inequality for future generations.</p>

<p>Quality ECD leads to better literacy and numeracy outcomes, better performance in primary school, social skills, improved attention spans, 
    improved confidence and resilience and a long term interest in learning. It also leads to fewer behavioural issues which can improve family 
    life.</p>

<p>Aside from the long-term benefits of ECD, early childhood should be a wonderful time when children have fun, learn to play alone and with 
    others, and are affirmed by knowing that they belong in a dependable group, in a safe and carefree haven. All these benefits of ECD are 
    immediate and impact all family members.To this end JCH established an Early Childhood Development Centre with the focus on school readiness, 
    proper nutrition and supporting family strength.</p>

<p>Our Early Childhood Development Centre, Funda Ngo Thando (Learn with Love) opened its doors in January 2021. We welcome children aged 2-3 and 3-4 for this first year. Any donors interested in supporting this project can contact
